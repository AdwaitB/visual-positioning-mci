Please consult the analysis.ipynb Jupyter notebook for a reproducible report. We have added markdown blocks which include explanation for the logic and references. We have also included and analysis.html which is basically the Jupyter notebook run save file on our side (although the results are reproducible on any machine with python 3.10). The notebook uses interactive plots, so sometimes we found that it fails to render the images, please rerun the kernel in that case.
